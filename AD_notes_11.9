AD notes, 11.9.32:
Information about setting up control logic from a TT (appendix D from text, which is not in the print book): 
https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/470/Appendix-D.pdf

I recommend we leave the control logic until last and then go through it.

Appendix A has all of the opcodes spelled out for each of the instructions we need to implement.

Figure 4.12 on p. 260 has a table with the control signals for most of the instructions we need, but some are missing.


Pieces we have:
ALU
Mux
RAM (SRAM? DRAM?)
D-flip-flops


What we need to make:
Register file (schematic on B-55; need to make registers; mux connections look tricky; recommend I start with this)
Data memory (from RAM)
Instruction memory (from RAM)
Sign extender (should be pretty simple)
Control Circuit (recommend we do last)
